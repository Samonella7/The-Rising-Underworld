list of needed updates
 this is really just for me, only read if you really have nothing better to do with your time
 (or if you want to help :D)

General issues:

Get all the scenarios well balanced, preferably with multiple difficulties (LOTS of work here)
Scatter some in-game dialogue- flavor stuff like the first time Reginald fights someone
Update the journey's map. Try using the track-placer this time, hm?
Consider using the new image_pos tag for messages
Think about those images you came up with while making VoaDaR (also, the new naga hunter and ants from UtBS)

06_The_Northern_Alliance
Gross balance issues if south orc team isn't smooshed?
Clean up the code. Specifically, a custom event should be used to make the dwarves come out
	instead of copying the code

08_In_the_Great_Ocean
Putting units on the same team while pushing is the best solution so far, but now enemies are 
	shown as allies during pushing. Still not ideal, here.

11_Tentacles_and_Serpents
put the island in between you and the lich so the fight is more interesting

15_Desperate_War
make-over the animation for the catapult; it really stinks.

18_Demon_Sicc
slightly reduce income so it's not only stupid but impossible to wait and earn gold for 
	an extra recall

22_Demon_Thal
to make the fight interesting, Thal gets a fleet of some small pest that poisons you
	so poison is almost everywhere, and then you have to fight
Maybe he doesn't even use undead, just those poison what-evers and swarms of whirlpools

23_Lichs_Den
 Fix the lighting in the Ciner cave. It's not doing quite what it should
