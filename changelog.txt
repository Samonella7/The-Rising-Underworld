* Sprite Changes:
	-Removed mainline campaigns from the credits
	-Added new sprites for the kracken, undead cuttlefish, skeleton mage, and demon ciner
	-Tweaked the skeleton sorcerer sprites

	-increased all sides' gold, especially Konrad III
	-Increased the amount of skeletons that try to stop your escape
	-The water/lava that almost cuts of your escape now appears in a turn 2 event
	-instead of recruiting, you start with 4 soldiers with special traits
	-Cut out lots of dialogue (it was way too windy before)
* Basically completely re-made 21_Demon_Umber
	-Map is much bigger
	-Umber's income is reliant on the dozens of villages he starts with, so you can 
		beat him by taking control of the map
	-There's a team of peasants fighting a hopeless cause to survive
	-New, more, and better dialogue
* 12_Canyon_of_the_Khalifate: changed the end battle so you can't just camp the
	cave mouth and kill the final enemies safely
* Various dialogue trims and other tweaks
	-Great horde doesn't sail south with the gang anymore, they stay in the north
		until Ferok needs them (in 10_The_Far_North)
	-New conersation between Dulthaus and Gepha when they first meet
* Various balance tweaks
-23_Lichs_Den: added more cave-path to Umber's part
-23_Lichs_Den: blocked off the southern dead-end sections
	(code for rings/units is unchanged, just the path is blocked off)
-18_Demon_Sicc: you're no longer forced to kill the demon with gepha 
	(though it's still a very good idea)
-22_Demon_Thal: tweaked the events & dialogue surrounding Reginald entering Fire Island
-Removed the big map of wesnoth picture, since i realized that mainline wesnoth 
	already has it
-Tweaked the skeleton mage stats
-Tweaked Demon Ciner & Zeph stats
-Nerfed Lombosilvitac-Sagadendol
