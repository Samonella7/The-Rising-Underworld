            story= _ "I don't mean the pictures of moldy old piles of stones that you see today. I don't mean the colorful models that you can find in gift shops. I mean the real thing; the colossal monument, the pinnacle of pride; the indomitable fortress."

            story= _ "If only we could have seen those fortresses in their true glory! Just imagine looking up at the blinding majesty, a castle from a peasant's point of view. There are the towers, standing proud and erect, hundreds of feet above your wondering head. There stream the banners, joyfully declaring their allegiance! Rows of imposing turrets circle the perimeter, daring anyone to challenge the castle's might. You could stare upwards for hours, just trying to see past the outer wall."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "In many ways, this fortress was like the re-formed Kingdom of Wesnoth. Just as the castle was constructed stone by stone by the labor of peasants and the strategy of architects, Wesnoth was built on the heroic labors of serfs and soldiers, engineered by the honest efforts of lords and nobles. Banners and flags are only a shadow of Wesnoth's pride; even the lowest farmers radiated their country's spirit, eagerly taking what burdens they were given and shining with a pride that would cow our world's nations. Where castles had turrets, Wesnoth had soldiers, and where castles had towers, Wesnoth had castles."

            story= _ "In the center of all the majesty and power was Konrad. King Konrad III, to be exact. In the earlier years of his reign (which began in 859 YW) he had led Wesnoth though turbulent times, proving himself to be both diplomatic and assertive."

            story= _ "Thirty-Two years after his coronation, King Konrad and his son, Prince Reginald, began to notice unusual happenings. Villages on the boarders of Wesnoth would suddenly cease to be heard from, and under inspection would be found burned. Konrad III responded appropriately, strengthening his patrols and guards in the southern regions, where the raids were most frequent."

            story= _ "If you are familiar with the story of the Eastern Invasion, perhaps you can guess what followed. Just as in 625YW, the raids were only a precursor; a precursor of the most severe invasion in history."

            story= _ "After loosing several battles against the unprecedented undead menace, Konrad resorted to desperate measures. If the Lich King himself could be vanquished, Konrad knew, his minions, the endless minions who were terrorizing Wesnoth, would return to the afterlife and leave their campaign of terror behind."
