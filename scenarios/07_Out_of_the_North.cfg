There they spent about a week, marveling at the vast variety of peoples; there were humans, elves, dwarves, mermen, and even orcs living together more peacefully than many of them had imagined possible."

            story= _ "During the stay, a council was held among the numerous chieftains. It was eventually decided that the elves, dwarves and humans, accompanied by Black-Eye Ferok, would return to Wesnoth together, where they could best plan how to defeat the dark lord Malidron."

            story= _ "Since the Ford of Abez would undoubtedly be fortified against their crossing, Ferok offered an alternate route across the Great River; some time ago, he had ordered the construction of an enormous fleet, which had just been completed. On board it, the entire army could safely avoid conflict by following the west coast to Elensefar."

        #What exactly were Feroks plans with said giant fleet? we'll never know.

            story= _ "A few days later, Dulthaus led the way through a dwarven tunnel which would surface just outside of the orcish docks, where an early snow storm had just whitened the landscape."
